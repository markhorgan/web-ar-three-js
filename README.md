# Web AR with Three.js

This is an example of working with AR on the web using Three.js. When a plane is detected a ring will appear. Tap the screen to place a box in the middle of the ring.

## Setup

You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 

Then type the following in a terminal:

	npm install

## To Run

	npm run start

This example needs to be run on a WebXR capable device that supports AR. On Android it requires Chrome v79 or above and on iOS you need to run it on the [Mozilla XR Viewer app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webxr-viewer/id1295998056). Make sure the desktop and smartphone are connected to the same WiFi network and enter the following `http://<IP address of desktop>:1234` in the address bar of the smartphone browser.
